# Flag_Of_Laos_Project
This is a CSS flag that I had created in Visual Studio Code, this is a project that the Udemy course, by Angela Yu had us write code in the CSS portion in order to learn about CSS combinations and positioning. Inside the HTML we were instructed to not change the HTML code in order for us to solidify our skills.
